We are already working on lollipop and pushed multiple alpha builds for both nexus 5 and 4 with some of our added features like privacy guard, sounds tweaks, status bar tweaks and much more. It's been decided that the new version of Slim + lollipop will be called SlimLP. We would like to thank +Cristian Giordano for the great work on the new boot animation. Stay tuned for more SlimLP news :)"
