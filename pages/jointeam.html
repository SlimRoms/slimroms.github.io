        <h2>Join SlimRoms team!</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>SlimRoms team is always looking grow. Currently we are looking for device maintainers, java developers, web designer and people interested in public relations.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Device Maintainers</h2>
        <div class="collection-list">
            <p>DM's are expected to test their devices routinly and keep their device trees updated</p>
            <p>They should know their way around android and be able to fix problems as they emerge for their device</p>
            <p>Basic knowledge of git is required, knowing how to work with gerrit is a plus</p>
            <p>Please provide links to your sources and xda thread</p>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Java Developers</h2>
        <p>We're always looking to recruit more java developers to help us shape up Slim. We’d favor fresh minds and ideas for a new user experience, whilst experience with Java is a requirement it doesn't necessarily have to be with Android. If dipping your toes into Android development is something you've wanted to do this might be the perfect opportunity.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Public Relations</h2>
        <p>We appear to be down a few public relations people, If you want to get involved but haven't due to lack of interest or skills in the technical side of things, this could be a good starting point. You would be responsible for drafting and posting all of the twitter/G+/FB posts and website posts and community moderating. Some level of CSS/Web knowledge would be beneficial but is not a hard requirement, we can provide any help and guidance required.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Web Designer</h2>
        <p>Somebody with a knowledge and experience of HTML/CSS and web design to help with our new website. Knowledge of web server infrastructure and Javascript isn’t a requirement.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>SlimRoms is a labor of love and the team donates their time to the project, as such none of these positons are paid.</p>
        <p>For all the above opportunities contact us at opportunities@slimroms.org</p>
