        <h2 class="title">TRPS!</h2>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Wednesday, 1st April 2015</h3>
        <p>We're back, and we're pink! After much research, we have realised that Material on Android isn't working so well.</p>
        <p>Over the past month, we have sent out different designs to some of our testers. The feedback that we got was the design is fine, it's just the colour scheme.</p>
        <p>We would like to officially announce TRPS! It's still in the works, but it will be coming to your devices soon.</p>
        <p>In support of this announcement, we have turned our <a href="https://review.slimroms.eu">Gerrit</a> pink.</p>
        <p>support us by turning something pink! Post pictures with #SlimPink. The best will be showcased on the new site.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Slim updates</h2>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Tuesday, 16 December 2014</h3>
        <p>As we mentioned couple weeks ago, we're working on SlimLP and already added some of our features e.g. Slim heads up, privacy guard, slim dialer, lockscreen shortcuts and much more. With the steady progress of SlimLP and current stability of Slimkat we decided to go for Slimkat 9.0 next week. With that being said we'll take the week off for testing purposes so no release this week, hope you have a great week and remember to <b>keep it slim.</b></p>

        <h2 class="title">SlimROMs meets lollipop</h2>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Saturday, 06 December 2014</h3>
        <p>As some of you already know we extended Slimkat weeklies to make them as stable as possible but that doesn't mean we're neglecting lollipop. We are already working on lollipop and pushed multiple alpha builds for both nexus 5 and 4 with some of our added features like privacy guard, sounds tweaks, status bar tweaks and much more. It's been decided that the new version of Slim + lollipop will be called SlimLP. We would like to thank +Cristian Giordano for the great work on the new boot animation. Stay tuned for more SlimLP news :)</p>

        <h2 class="title">SlimROMs moves to Crowdin</h2>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Friday, 21 November 2014</h3>
        <p>We have officially moved all translations back to crowdin. <b>What does that mean?</b></p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Easier way for users to translate SlimRoms to their language with a slight to no learning curve.</li>
            <li>We won't accept new translations on Gerrit. All the translations must be made through crowdin.</li>
        </ol>
        <span class="heading">Before users had to:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Have Git.</li>
            <li>Clone the repo in question.</li>
            <li>Do the changes, commit and push them to our Gerrit.</li>
            <li>Add someone from the team to review and merge the translations.</li>
        </ul>
